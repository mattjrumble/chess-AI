# Chess AI in VB.NET

Plays a game of chess against the player. The single 'chess_AI.vb' file handles both displaying the game/user input, and the logic behind the AI's moves. AI moves are made using minimax with alpha-beta pruning. Castling and en-passant are not implemented, but it plays a full game aside from that.

(I wrote this in college, seemingly before I thought separating functionality into different files was a good idea)
